# Test Project 1 [UFC Height]
Does height win MMA fights?


##### Hypothesis
Given that height (or rather reach) is an important stat for combat sports
there should be a correlation between height and win percentage.

##### Process
1. Merged two data sets (fights + fighters) to attain a list 
of all fight outcomes along with respective heights.

2. Visualized the merged data set as well as a data set
containing height differences.

##### Conclusion
We fail to reject the null hypothesis, height and height
advantage does not affect MMA win/loss.
